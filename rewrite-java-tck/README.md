## Rewrite Java Technology Compatibility Kit

This project contains the source code for the Rewrite Java Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). The TCK is a set of tests that can be used to verify that a `JavaParser` implementation conforms to expectations.

### Dependency relationships with `rewrite-java-tck`

Dependency relationships between parser implementations and the TCK:

```mermaid
classDiagram
`rewrite-java-tck` ..> `rewrite-java`: implementation
`rewrite-java-tck` ..> `rewrite-java-test`: implementation
`rewrite-java-17` ..> `rewrite-java-tck` : compatibilityTest classpath
`rewrite-java-11` ..> `rewrite-java-tck` : compatibilityTest classpath
`rewrite-java-8` ..> `rewrite-java-tck` : compatibilityTest classpath
`rewrite-groovy` ..> `rewrite-java-test` : testImplementation
`rewrite-java` ..> `rewrite-java-test` : testImplementation
`rewrite-java-tck` ..> `rewrite-java-17`: testRuntimeOnly
```

* The `testRuntimeOnly` dependency that `rewrite-java-tck` has on `rewrite-java-17` allows us to run these tests in the IDE.
* The `rewrite-java` dependency on `rewrite-java-test` is for testing the Java Reflection type mapping.
* `rewrite-java-tck` should be bound to the latest language level supported at any given time.
